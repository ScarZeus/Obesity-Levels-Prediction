# Obesity-Levels-Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts obesity levels in individuals based on lifestyle factors and personal characteristics. The model will classify subjects into standard BMI categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and three classes of obesity) using readily available personal information without requiring medical tests.The prediction system will analyze factors such as eating habits, physical activity levels, demographic data, and behavioral patterns to identify individuals at risk of obesity. Using supervised learning algorithms, the model will be trained on datasets containing labeled obesity classifications along with corresponding lifestyle and demographic features.This tool could serve healthcare providers for early intervention, assist individuals in understanding their obesity risk factors, and potentially support public health initiatives targeting obesity prevention. The project demonstrates practical applications of machine learning in preventive healthcare while addressing a significant global health concern.
